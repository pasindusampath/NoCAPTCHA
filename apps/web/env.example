# Next.js Frontend Application Configuration
# This file is a template. Copy to .env for actual configuration.
# The .env file can be committed since NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables are safe to expose.

# API Configuration
# Backend API URL - Used for making API requests
# For local development: http://localhost:3000
# For hosting/production: https://turnstile-api.pasindusampath.com
# Note: When running locally, you can override this with .env.local (gitignored)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://turnstile-api.pasindusampath.com

# Cloudflare Turnstile Configuration
# Get your keys from: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
# Site Key: Public key used in frontend (safe to expose in client-side code)
# This is the public key that will be embedded in your frontend code
# Note: In Next.js, environment variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are exposed to the browser
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_SITE_KEY=your_site_key_here

# ============================================
# Environment-Specific Examples
# ============================================

# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
# Create apps/web/.env.local (gitignored) with:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_SITE_KEY=your_local_site_key

# PRODUCTION/HOSTING
# Uses the values in .env file (this file)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://turnstile-api.pasindusampath.com
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_SITE_KEY=your_production_site_key

# ============================================
# Notes
# ============================================
# - All environment variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are exposed to the browser
# - Never put sensitive keys (like secret keys) in NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables
# - The Cloudflare Site Key is safe to expose (it's meant to be public)
# - The Secret Key should only be in the backend API environment variables
# - After updating .env file, restart the Next.js dev server for changes to take effect
